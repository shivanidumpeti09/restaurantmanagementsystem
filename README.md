# Restaurant Management System - Frontend (HTML/CSS)

This repository contains the frontend components (HTML and CSS) for a Restaurant Management System web application.

## Project Description

This project focuses on building the user interface for a restaurant management system. The frontend is designed to provide a user-friendly experience for restaurant staff and potentially customers (depending on the scope). It includes features for:

* **Menu Management:** Displaying, adding, editing, and deleting menu items.
* **Order Management:** Taking orders, tracking order status, and managing existing orders.
* **User Authentication:** Login and registration for staff members.
* **Feedback:** Allows users to provide feedback.
* **Customer Information:** Manages customer details.

This repository primarily handles the visual aspect of the application. The backend functionality (data storage, server-side logic) is assumed to be handled separately.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For structuring the web pages.
* **CSS3:** For styling the web pages and creating a responsive layout.
